## Introduction:
In this assignment, we suppose to simulate Netflix service by using OOP principles.
I have Completed the following classes by adding the required parameters and implementing the predefined functions: *Movie*, *User*, *TVShow*, *NetflixService*.
In the **runMenu*()* function of the Main class, I implemented an interactive menu in the command line that allows users to use the functionalities of the program.
In this simulation, User can search among the movies and tv shows and decide to watch or add them to his favorite list , and he is also allowed to change his username and password.

## Design:
In Main, there is a function *mainmenu* for better user experience. User can choose between several options in main menu to use our simulated Netflix.
## Challenges:
In this assignment, simulating the “Get Recommendations “ part was a little challenging.
I tried to recommend those movie or tv shows that user have been watched or saved in his favorite list . I guess that was the easiest way!
